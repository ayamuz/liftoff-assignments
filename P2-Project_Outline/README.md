## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Mental Health Access is a site dedicated to finding mental health care, with emphasis in Spanish-speaking providers, updated information on provider availability (e.g., are they taking new patients?), provider specializatrion (psychiatric services, cognitive behavioral therapy, etc.) availability of out-of pocket discounts, and accommodations for non-US citizens. This site stems from the difficulties lived by some of the developers while trying to find mental health care in Saint Louis, and the lack of centralized system that provides relevant information.
